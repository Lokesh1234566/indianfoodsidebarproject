This state of rasa is 'Ama' where the impaired vatadi doshas being mixed up with one another lead to the ama-dosha- According to Vagbhata (A .H. Su. 13/25). The disease amavata is formed due to such vitiated ama-doshas. Madhav-nidana explains this disease descriptively Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term disease that leads to inflammation of the joints and surrounding tissues. It can also affect other organs."
